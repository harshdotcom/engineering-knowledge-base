## Neural Network (Simple Explanation)

# Video-01

- Neural networks are inspired by how the human visual cortex works.
- A neuron is a small unit that stores a number.
- An activation value (for example, 0.59) represents how active a neuron is.
- The activation of a layer depends on the activations from the previous layer.
- A sigmoid function is commonly used to convert values into a range between 0 and 1.
- Each column can be treated as a vector, and all weights together form a matrix.
- Linear algebra is a fundamental requirement to understand neural networks.
- ReLu (a) = max(0, a)

This video explains how a neural network learns from data.

- Learning happens by adjusting **weights** and **biases**.
- Weights and biases control how input values affect the output.
- A **cost function** measures how wrong the network’s output is.
- The goal is to reduce the cost by updating weights and biases.
- **Multivariable calculus** is used to understand and perform these updates.

This video gives a high-level understanding of how large language models (LLMs) work.

- LLMs learn patterns in data and are improved using techniques like reinforcement learning.
- GPUs are important because training and running these models requires massive parallel computation.
- Transformers are the core architecture behind modern LLMs.
- Attention mechanisms in transformers help models focus on the most relevant parts of the input.
